## Overview

 Hey, Yash here , the work which you see above is an inspiration from [https://pin.it/6niC27f] this pinterest post.Instead of the traditional layout for websites which we all see everywhere , this design was unique so I decided to give a try to  replicate this design into a website.The primary objective of this project is to practice working with grids and challenge myself to create something distinct and innovative.
      
You may have suggestions, improvements, or bug fixes, please feel free to submit a pull request or open an issue in the project repository.We can work that out together :)


### Links

- Live Site URL: [https://itsyashk1406.github.io/css-startuplayout/]

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

By taking up this challenge I got a better understanding of CSS Grid.
One of the important thing I got to learn is that only use the properties when its actually needed rather than ending up with some bug in the code which is caused because you used something earlier in the code.
Also I realised that its okay to use hit and trial method to see what thing works the best for your site.

### Continued development

In future projects I will be more aware while defining the grid rows and columns.I also came across the bug that  
```background-clip:text;``` and ```subgrid``` works differently on Chrome and Firefox.Looking forward to find some comman ground for croos browser supports.
